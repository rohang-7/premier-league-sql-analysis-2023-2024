-- Lets Load the CSV into the matches table. May need to start the client with: mysql --local-infile=1 
-- and might need to change privileges to set GLOBAL local_infile.

USE premier_league;

-- Enable LOCAL INFILE if permitted
SET GLOBAL local_infile = 1;

-- Adjust the file path for the machine
--   /Users/yourname/foldername/matches_final.csv
-- This script loads the Premier League match data CSV into the matches table.
-- It enables local file import, reads the CSV line by line, converts date/time formats, replaces empty values with NULL, 
-- and runs quick validation checks â€” showing warnings, total rows loaded, and a sample of imported data.
